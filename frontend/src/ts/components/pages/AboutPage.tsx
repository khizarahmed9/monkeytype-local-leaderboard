          Monkeytype is a minimalistic and customizable typing test. It features
          many test modes and user-configurable features such as themes, sounds, a smooth caret,
          and more. Monkeytype attempts to emulate the experience of natural
          keyboard typing during a typing test, by unobtrusively presenting the
          text prompts and displaying typed characters in-place, providing
          straightforward, real-time feedback on typos, speed, and accuracy.
          <br />
          <br />
          Test yourself in various modes, track your progress and improve your
          speed.

          By default, this website uses the most common 200 words in the English
          language to generate its tests. You can change to an expanded set
          (1000 most common words) in the options, or change the language
          entirely.

          You can use <QuickRestartHotkey /> to restart the typing test. Open
          the command line by pressing <CommandlineHotkey /> - there you can
          access all the functionality you need without touching your mouse.

          After completing a test you will be able to see your wpm, raw wpm,
          accuracy, character stats, test length and test
          info (you can hover over some values to get floating point numbers).
          You can also see a graph of your wpm and raw over the duration of the
          test. Remember that the wpm line is a global average, while the raw
          wpm line is a local, momentary value (meaning if you stop, the value
          is 0).
